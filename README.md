# odin-recipes
<!--This project is all about creating a very basic HTML page that contains relative links,ordered and unordered lists,
    images without any CSS or JS. 
    Food recipes will be the content to create this webpage and organizing related directories,
    folders/subfolders in a proper manner will be the key outcome for this project session.
   
    Learning how to 'commit' into changes within the code and add meaningful notes on Github will be other desired practical skills along the way.-->
